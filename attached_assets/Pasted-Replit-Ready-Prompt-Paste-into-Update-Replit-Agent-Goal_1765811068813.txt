Replit-Ready Prompt (Paste into Update / Replit Agent)

Goal: Produce a Replit-optimized version of the Draft Clinic PRD implementation plan + a runnable starter repo blueprint, using the PRD I already have (Draft Clinic = Page Doctor replica + SA payments + POPIA + global reach).

Critical instruction: Do not ask clarifying questions. Do not pause mid-output. Do not say “continue” or stop halfway. Produce the full answer in one uninterrupted response. If something is ambiguous, make a reasonable default and clearly label it as an assumption.

Output Required (Single Continuous Response)

Replit Project Architecture Decision

Choose a stack that runs well on Replit (assume: Python + Node supported).

Provide rationale: what runs in one Replit vs multiple repls.

Must include: backend, frontend, DB, cache, queues, storage strategy for MVP on Replit.

Repository Layout (Monorepo)

Provide an explicit file tree:

/backend (Python app)

/frontend (web UI)

/infra (optional)

Include exact filenames and what each contains.

Replit Configuration

Provide:

.replit content (run commands, ports, entrypoints)

replit.nix content (system deps, Python/Node versions)

Include how to set up Replit Secrets (env vars list).

Local-to-Prod Parity Plan

Explain how the Replit MVP maps to AWS production later:

Replit filesystem → S3

Replit DB/Postgres → RDS

Replit cron/jobs → SQS/Lambda/Workers

Replit hosting → CloudFront + ALB + ECS

Runnable MVP Skeleton (Code-Level Plan)

Provide a minimal but real implementation plan with:

Auth (email/password + Google OAuth placeholders)

Document upload (store locally in Replit for MVP; interface designed to swap to S3)

Quote engine (word count extraction + pricing rules)

Basic job workflow statuses

Admin dashboard endpoints (minimal)

Provide API endpoints + sample request/response JSON.

Database Schema + Migrations

Provide schema for: users, profiles, jobs, job_files, quotes, orders, payments, notifications, assignments, disputes, invoices.

Provide indexing plan.

Provide migration approach (Django migrations or Alembic, depending on chosen framework).

Background Jobs on Replit

Provide how to run:

virus scan stub

word count extraction

email sender stub

Must run in Replit constraints (single repl).

Provide a pragmatic MVP approach.

Payments Strategy for Replit MVP

Implement payment flow as:

gateway “mock adapter” + webhook simulator for MVP

interface pattern to swap in PayFast/Yoco/Ozow/Stripe/PayPal later

Include webhook security guidelines.

Security/Compliance in MVP

POPIA/GDPR requirements: what you can realistically do in Replit MVP vs what must wait for AWS.

Must include: encryption approach, access control, signed URL approach (or equivalent), retention policy job.

Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

Exact steps:

install deps

run backend

run frontend

seed admin user

run tests

Include expected ports + Replit “Open in new tab” notes.

Constraints

Must preserve the Page Doctor-like flow: select service + turnaround → upload → instant quote → checkout/pay → assign reviewer → deliver reviewed doc.

Must keep SA-specific needs in mind: VAT invoice generation capability, multi-currency structure, POPIA posture.

Do not stop mid-way. No partial output.

MAke it AWS friendly I want to run and include documentation for AWS implementation  x`
